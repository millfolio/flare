"""HTTP/2 cleartext via Upgrade dance, client side (RFC 7540 §3.2).

Drives the new ``HttpClient(h2c_upgrade=True)`` path against the
existing unified-reactor server (which already handles inbound
``Upgrade: h2c`` requests). The client sends an HTTP/1.1 request
decorated with ``Connection: Upgrade, HTTP2-Settings``, ``Upgrade:
h2c``, and ``HTTP2-Settings: <base64url>``; the server replies
``101 Switching Protocols`` and the response for the original
request flows back over h2 on stream id 1.

Tests:

- ``test_upgrade_round_trip``: 101 + h2 response on stream 1.
- ``test_upgrade_concurrent_clients``: a second h2c-upgrade client
  on the same server gets its own response (process-level
  isolation, but it asserts the upgrade path is re-entrant).
- ``test_upgrade_falls_back_when_server_does_not_speak_h2``: when
  pointed at a stub that always answers an h1 200, the client
  surfaces that response unchanged.
- ``test_upgrade_with_request_body``: the original h1 body is
  delivered before the 101 switch and the h2 stream-1 response is
  read correctly.
