# TLS strategy

flare's TLS layer today is **OpenSSL via FFI** through
[`flare/tls/ffi/openssl_wrapper.cpp`](../flare/tls/ffi/openssl_wrapper.cpp).
That choice has carried through v0.6 (server-side, hot reload),
v0.7 (session resumption, ALPN dispatch), and v0.8
(no changes to the TLS backend; new features layered on top --
``WsClient.connect_prefer_h2`` advertises ALPN, the
``HttpClient`` over ``https://`` advertises ``["h2",
"http/1.1"]``). This page documents the rationale, the
boundaries, and the v0.9 commitment that lands alongside the
QUIC server.

## Current posture

| Aspect | Status |
|---|---|
| TLS backend | OpenSSL 3.x via FFI. Pinned per pixi env. |
| Protocols | TLS 1.2 + 1.3. TLS 1.0 / 1.1 explicitly refused. |
| Cipher policy | Forward-secret AEAD whitelist. RC4 / 3DES / CBC chains absent from the negotiated set. |
| ALPN | Advertised on both sides; refusal-to-downgrade enforced. |
| Cert reload | ``TlsAcceptor.reload()`` atomic swap (no in-flight drop). |
| Session resumption | RFC 5077 tickets + RFC 8446 §4.6.1 ``NewSessionTicket`` capture/replay. Server-side opt-in via ``TlsServerConfig.enable_session_tickets``; client-side opt-in via ``TlsConfig.enable_session_resumption``. |
| mTLS | Construction-time CA chain validation; ``TlsAcceptor.with_client_cert_verification`` enforces presence + chain. |
| OCSP stapling | Not in-tree. Most production deployments terminate TLS at a proxy with stapling enabled. |
| Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) | Not in-tree. The plan is to land it when OpenSSL stable carries it. |

## Why OpenSSL + FFI rather than a Mojo-native stack

Three reasons, in priority order:

1. **Coverage.** OpenSSL handles the entire matrix: TLS 1.2 +
   1.3, every cipher policy real customers ask for, OCSP, ALPN,
   session tickets, NewSessionTicket replay, the cert-chain
   builder, the X.509 verifier, certificate-name matching with
   wildcard + IP-literal SANs. Re-implementing any one of these
   in Mojo would be a six-month project for marginal value.
2. **Trust.** OpenSSL is the most-audited TLS stack on the
   planet. Every CVE that lands gets a same-day pixi bump --
   far better than carrying our own bug in the bytes we put on
   the wire.
3. **Footprint.** The FFI shim is < 600 lines of C++; the rest
   is Mojo. We do not pay for the abstraction layer at runtime
   (the FFI calls inline into the reactor's read / write
   stages with one libc indirection).

The alternative (Mojo-native TLS) was scoped during v0.6: the
shape would require a 5K+-line Mojo crate plus a separate set
of conformance suites (NIST SP 800-52, BoringSSL test vectors).
That is the same investment as the rest of flare's HTTP/2 + WS
+ runtime layers combined. The cost is not justified.

## Why rustls for QUIC (v0.9)

QUIC has a different TLS shape than TLS-over-TCP: the handshake
runs inside QUIC frames, the keys are derived per-encryption-
level (Initial / Handshake / 1-RTT / 0-RTT), and the API the
TLS library exposes is record-shaped rather than byte-stream-
shaped. OpenSSL's QUIC API has shipped in 3.2+ but is
**not** the BoringSSL QUIC API that the broader ecosystem
(quiche, ngtcp2, lsquic, msquic) standardised on. Building
against OpenSSL 3.2+ QUIC means re-implementing the
key-derivation + record-shape dance that the rest of the
ecosystem ships off-the-shelf.

For v0.9, flare's QUIC server will use **rustls + quinn-style
QUIC API bindings** through a Rust FFI shim. The rationale:

- `rustls` carries the BoringSSL-shape QUIC API natively (the
  `QuicConfig` / `QuicServer` traits already exist).
- The Rust toolchain is in `pixi.toml` already (the bench
  harness baselines build via cargo); adding a second
  ``rustls_wrapper`` shim is a small extension.
- A single TLS strategy for QUIC + new TLS-over-TCP wires
  (h2 / WS-over-h2) is technically possible but blows up the
  v0.9 scope; v0.9 keeps the OpenSSL path for TCP, adds the
  rustls path for QUIC, and v0.10 considers whether to
  collapse onto a single backend.

This decision was recorded in design-0.8.mdc under the
`tls-strategy` question and confirmed (`rustls-quic`) in this
cycle.

## What stays out-of-tree

- **Certificate issuance + renewal**: use certbot / cert-
  manager / ACME directly. flare's ``TlsAcceptor.reload`` is
  the integration point.
- **TLS 1.3 0-RTT**: not implemented. Replay protection is
  trickier than it looks and the win is small for our target
  workloads (API servers + sidecars).
- **DTLS / SCTP**: not in scope.
- **CRL / OCSP responder**: out-of-tree; if you need
  revocation enforcement, terminate at a proxy.

## Version + verification cadence

| Pin | Where | When it changes |
|---|---|---|
| OpenSSL major | `pixi.toml` ``openssl = ">=3.6.1,<4"`` | On CVE response or scheduled minor bump. |
| Conda channel | `pixi.toml` ``channels = ["conda-forge"]`` | Stable; conda-forge is the single source of truth. |
| TLS test corpus | `tests/tls/test_tls*.mojo` | Every release cycle; runs under sanitiser. |
| TLS session-resumption replay test | `tests/tls/test_tls_resume.mojo` | Every release cycle. |
